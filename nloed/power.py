# function for power analysis with given design and 

#use sigma points (or if needed monte carlo simulation) to determine 'power curve', shrinking of parameter error (bias +var) with n design replications
#perhaps combine with rounding methods?? to allow for rounded variations of the same design.
# rounding should probably happen here
